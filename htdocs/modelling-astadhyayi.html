<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Modelling Astadhyayi</h3><hr/>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of less than 4000 sutras in Ashtadhyayi is similar to a computer program -- with one major difference -- the program being written for a human being and not for a machine -- thereby allowing non formal or semi formal sutras for whose interpretation/implementation, assistance from a human being is required. Nevertheless, we believe strongly that the study of ashtaadhyaayi from programming point of view may lead to a new programming paradigm. With an intension to understand Ashtadhaayii in a better way, we have tried to implement the 'derivation of inflected nouns'. The paper describing the implementation is available <a href="http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/AmbaSimulationEdited4.pdf">here </a></p>
<ul>
<li>The demonstration of the program is available <a href="ashtadhyayi_simulator/index.html">here.</a></li>
