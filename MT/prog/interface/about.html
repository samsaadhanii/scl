<title>About Anusaaraka</title>
</head>
<body>
The Sanskrit - Hindi Anusaaraka cum Anuvaadaka is a tool to assist a reader in understanding a Sanskrit text. The anuvaadaka though produces a translation, many a times the output is not correct, or is un-intellegible. In such cases, Anusaaraka guides the reader through various stages of analysis. A reader who is ready to take some extra efforts in understanding the text has all the detailed analysis of the text available to him, and based on the context, a reader can then interpret the text.
<p>
The analysis is done following the standard steps in Indian Grammatical tradition viz.
<ul>
<li> Padapāṭha </li>
<li> Pada paricaya </li>
<li> samasta pada viccheda </li>
<li> samasta pada paricaya </li>
<li> vākya vākya viśleṣaṇa following ākāṃkṣā and sannidhi </li>
<li> artha nirdhāraṇa (to be added) </li>

</ul>
