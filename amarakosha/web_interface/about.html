<p>Welcome to the web version of Amarakosha. This web version helps you in searching words in Amarakosh bearing various kinds of semantic relations to the given word. The semantic relations enabled are: <b> synonymy (paryaaya padas), subordintate(hyponymy), superordinate(hyprenymy), part of (avayava), whole (avayavI), pati-patni, sva-svaamibhaava, etc.</b>  Placing a cursor on a word shows its position in the Amarakosha and its gender. </p>
<p>By selecting the option 'all relations', one can also see all the possible relations depicted in Amarakosh for a given word. An attempt is also made to provide an ontology for each word. </p>
<p>More details are available in Ph.D. thesis<a href="amarakosha_knowledge_structure.pdf">The Knowledge Structure in Amarakosha</a> of Ms. Shivaja Nair. </p>
