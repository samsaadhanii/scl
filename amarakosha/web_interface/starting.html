It is one of the books which an Indian child learning through Indian traditional educational system memorizes as early as his first year of formal learning. Though it appears as a linear list of words, close inspection of it shows a rich organisation of words expressing various relations a word bears with other words. Thus when a child studies this Amarakosha further, the linear list of words unfolds into a knowledge web. This web tool is an effort to make the implicit knowledge in Amarakosha explicit. Further, the lexical entries in Amarakosha are also classified according to <a href="vESeRika_ontology.jpg">extended Vaisheshika Ontology</a>. This <a href="amarakosha_knowledge_structure.pdf">work</a> was awarded a 
Ph.D. degree in Sanksrit Studies by University of Hyderabad.
